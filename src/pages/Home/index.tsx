        I am a brazilian frontend developer with recent expertise in React based application
        - about 5 years. <br />
        <br />
        I used to live in a time where frontend was not a nightmare like today, where every
        single day has a new library.
        <br />
        <br />
        I've been programming since 2008, where I first coded a "hello world" with
        Actionscript (flash ‚ù§Ô∏è) - learnt to code by myself.
        <br />
        <br />
        I've experienced all web transformations, since internet explorer 6!, browser
        environment those days was a hard task. Almost 15 years working with web development
        and still learning new skills like React, typescript, zustand, node, vite and all
        these new amazing technologies.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have some backend experience with the so loved and hated PHP as well. But in
        recent years I have been fully dedicated to the frontend area.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am passionate about game development, not engine development but
        from-scratch-development.
        <br />
        <br />
        This personal page is about my adventure in learning game dev core.
